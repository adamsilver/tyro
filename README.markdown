In a sentence
-------------

Tyro is another (super-lightweight) JavaScript (MVC) framework inspired by Backbone, CorMVC and Sammy.

In slightly more detail
-----------------------

We hope this project aids in building single page web applications without prescribing too much; we want you, the developer, to lean on the tool, as opposed to rely on it. Technically speaking, you could use Tyro without any models and views and instead munge all the layers into what we call the controllers, but we don't advise this.

A very simple quick start guide
