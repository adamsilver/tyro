In a sentence
-------------

Tyro is another (super-lightweight) JavaScript (MVC) framework inspired by Backbone, CorMVC and Sammy.

In slightly more detail
-----------------------

Tyro aids in building single page web applications without prescribing too much!

Tyro lets you, the developer decide how to structure your application - after all, it should be designed and built to your custom specification. Technically speaking, you could use Tyro without any models and views and instead munge all the layers into the controllers, but of course we don't advise this!

Dependencies
------------

Tyro has a few dependencies, but these could easily be ripped / swapped out and changed to whatever you want. Currently Tyro is built on top of jQuery and jQuery.HashChange (you know the guy that wrote jQuery BBQ).

Okay, Okay, so technically what does Tyro currently provide?
------------------------------------------------------------

- Reacting to hash changes via 'routes'
- Kicking off controllers
- Setting the hash value
